# RaspberryPiRover
A Raspberry Pi 4-based rover controlled using a PS4 controller via Bluetooth. On startup, a shell script automatically connects the controller, and a Python script maps button inputs to control the motors. This project demonstrates simple real-time control of a mobile robot using common hardware and basic scripting.
